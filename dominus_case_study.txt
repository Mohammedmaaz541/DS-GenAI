Diminos Store – Delivery Time Analysis
Freelance Data Scientist Report

------------------------------------
1. Problem Overview
------------------------------------
Kanav owns a Diminos pizza store that operates 24x7. Diminos promises
customers delivery within 31 minutes, failing which the order is free.
To evaluate store performance, Diminos uses a key metric:
the 95th percentile of delivery time must be less than 31 minutes.

Kanav wants to understand whether his store meets this requirement
and what actions can be taken to avoid losing the franchise.

------------------------------------
2. Dataset Description
------------------------------------
The dataset contains order-level delivery information with the
following columns:

- order_id: Unique identifier for each order
- order_placed_at: Time when the order was placed
- order_delivered_at: Time when the order was delivered

Delivery time is calculated as the difference between
order_delivered_at and order_placed_at in minutes.

------------------------------------
3. Understanding the 95th Percentile Metric
------------------------------------
The 95th percentile delivery time represents the time within which
95 percent of orders are delivered.

Diminos' requirement:
95th percentile delivery time < 31 minutes

This means that only the slowest 5 percent of orders are allowed to
exceed 31 minutes. Even a small number of delayed deliveries can
cause the store to fail this metric.

------------------------------------
4. Sample Delivery Time Observation
------------------------------------
From the sample data provided, most orders are delivered within
15–20 minutes. However, some orders take significantly longer
(for example, one order took around 38 minutes).

These delayed orders act as outliers and have a strong impact
on the 95th percentile value.

------------------------------------
5. Key Insights
------------------------------------
1. Most orders are delivered well within the promised time,
   indicating good average performance.
2. A small number of late deliveries can push the 95th percentile
   beyond 31 minutes, putting the franchise at risk.
3. Late deliveries are likely to occur during peak hours,
   late-night operations, or when delivery staff is insufficient.
4. Average delivery time alone is not enough to judge performance;
   controlling outliers is critical.

------------------------------------
6. Business Recommendations
------------------------------------
To ensure the 95th percentile delivery time stays below 31 minutes,
Kanav should take the following actions:

Short-Term Actions:
- Increase delivery staff during peak hours
- Prioritize orders once delivery time crosses 25 minutes
- Monitor live delivery delays

Medium-Term Actions:
- Analyze delivery times by hour and day
- Improve kitchen workflow during rush periods
- Optimize delivery routes

Long-Term Actions:
- Set an internal delivery target of 27–28 minutes
- Use historical data to predict peak demand
- Create alerts when delivery time trends approach risk levels

------------------------------------
7. Conclusion
------------------------------------
Although most Diminos orders are delivered on time, delayed orders
significantly affect the 95th percentile delivery metric.

By reducing late deliveries and focusing on operational efficiency,
Kanav can meet Diminos’ performance requirements, retain the
franchise, and improve customer satisfaction.
